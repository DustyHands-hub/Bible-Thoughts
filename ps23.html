                your rod and your staff reassure me.</p>

                <strong>V.1</strong><br>
                David is the Psalmist here, and he grew up as a shepherd boy. So the allusion of a sheep-shepherd relationship was one very familiar to him. <br>
                The verb translated as "want," eh-sar, comes from the word khaser meaning to lack/need something. See <em>Deut. 8:9; Prov. 10:21.</em> <br>
                <em><strong>Question:</strong></em> What does a shepherd do? What does it mean for the Lord to be our Shepherd?
            </p> <hr>
            <p class="ps23v2 notespace">
                <strong>V.2</strong><br>
                A shepherd will take care of his sheep. He leads them to pastures to eat, to water to drink, he protects the herd. <br>
                The word "still" here is menuhowt in Hebrew. It refers to a place of rest. See <em>1 Kings 8:56; 1 Chronicles 22:9.</em><br>
                <em><strong>Question:</strong></em> In what way does God provide for us? Particularly rest?
            </p> <hr>
            <p class="ps23v3 notespace">
                <strong>V.3</strong><br>
                The word here, strength, is naphshi. It comes from nephesh, which means throat, but often refers to the soul or entire person. And restore has a sense of returning to a state you were once in. But it isn't for our sake that He restores our souls, it's for the sake of His name. Everyone in creation is for His glory. <br>
                <em><strong>Question:</strong></em> How are our souls restored? What state are they in now, and what state are they being restored to? How does doing this glorify God?
            </p> <hr>
            <p class="ps23v4 notespace">
                <strong>V.4</strong><br>
                This verse pictures the shepherd taking his sheep through a dark ravine where predators might lurk. <br>
                There is debate about what the Hebrew here means. Valley of darkness? Shadow of death? The word is used in some places to refer to a deep darkness, and others to refer to the land of the dead. See <em>Job 3:5; 10:21-22.</em> <br>
                <em><strong>Question:</strong></em> What sort of "valley" would David be walking through at this time? Do we walk through valleys similar to this today?

                <span id="verseNum">5</span>
                Trust in the Lord with all your heart,
                and do not rely on your own understanding. <br>
                <span id="verseNum">6</span>

                <span id="verseNum">9</span> Just as it is written, “He has scattered widely, he has given to the poor; his righteousness remains forever.” <br>
