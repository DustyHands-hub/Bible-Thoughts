                David is the Psalmist here, and he grew up as a shepherd boy. So the allusion of a sheep-shepherd relationship was one very familiar to him. <br>
                The verb translated as "want," eh-sar, comes from the word khaser meaning to lack/need something. See <em>Deut. 8:9; Prov. 10:21.</em> <br>
